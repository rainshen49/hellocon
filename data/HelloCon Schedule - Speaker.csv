Day 1,There is a 5min break between each talk,,,
Session 1,Speaker,Title,Abstract,BIO
11:30 AM,Mike Conley,"Why I can play Maniac Mansion on my Windows 10 box, my Palm Pilot, and my DreamCast.","When I was growing up, I loved playing point-and-click adventure games. These are the 90's-era games where you play a character that walks around, talks to people, picks up things, and solves puzzles in order to progress the story. Famous examples include the Monkey Island series, Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max Hit the Road, The Dig, Gabriel Knight, the Kings Quest series and the Space Quest series. There are many more, but those were my favourites.

Those games are probably the primary reason I got into computing. I wanted to know how they worked, and I wanted to know how I could make one.

It turns out I'm not alone: an entire community exists to figure out how these sort of games work, and to get them to run on modern (and not so modern hardware). This is the ScummVM community.

This talk is mainly about what allows these games to be ported to such a diverse set of platforms without having any access to the original source code.","I'm a software engineer working at Mozilla on the Firefox Desktop web browser. When I'm not at work, I play in a rock band, I ride my bike, and try to improve my cooking skills."
11:45 AM,Henrik Bechmann,Developing an interactive budget explorer for the Toronto budget using React and Google Charts,"We wanted to present the Toronto budget in an interactive analytics framework for relatively easy public consumption. We had some experience collecting city data, a lot of development experience, and some experience in organizing such data visually. To implement a solution we had to invent a data intake mechanism that accommodated low quality data, a taxonomy scheme to organize varying kinds of data, and a front end that could display both simple and (relatively) complex analytics. The front end also had to be responsive. A combination of reactive programming, hybrid state management, and clear component design lead to a successful early implementation","I'm a retired software developer, working on passion projects on my bucket list. One such is budgetpedia.ca, started in July 2015, which aims to make the Toronto budget more accessible to the people of Toronto. Last November we released version 0.1 to good reception! I'm the project lead, and the project was fostered by Civic Tech Toronto, where I'm one of the organizers.

I've also been a community activist from time to time, and enjoy watching the world get weirder as I get older. There were only 2.5B people on the planet when I was born (1950). Now look what we've done!

12:00 PM,Ori Bernstein,Good Enough Malloc,"Production implementations of malloc are complex and difficult to understand. However, the core algorithm used in many of them is beautifully simple.

In this talk, I present a slab allocator that has comparable performance to the state of the art, in about 1% of the code. If there is time, I will discuss why it falls flat on its face under certain workloads, and what it would take to make it useful in production.
","I am a human person who likes writing code. I was born once, and I've spent my time being alive ever since.
I'm currently working at a startup doing embedded development. In the past, I've worked on Facebook's network systems and Google's ad serving. In my spare time, I'm hacking on my own programming language and mucking around in obscure systems like Plan 9.
"
12:15 PM,Liz Baillie,Ruby is Awesome and Rust is Awesome and Building a Game in Both is AWESOME,"Learning to program in Ruby was super fun, but I kept hearing people talk about typed languages that are so-called ""closer to the metal,"" like Rust. It seemed intimidating, but I was curious! I built a small, text-based adventure game in both Ruby and Rust, side-by-side, so I could see what the differences and similarities were. I learned a lot, and now I'm here to share it all with you!","Liz is currently wrangling the JavaScripts and herding the Rubies as an engineer at Tilde. Previously, she spent many years drawing comic books to a limited but enthusiastic audience. She is just getting started at contributing to open source projects and is already addicted. Please send help (don't actually send help)."
Session 2,,,,
1:30 PM,Charu Jaiswal,How to Get Started in Machine Learning,,"I’m a machine learning scientist at Peak Power Energy, where I use machine learning to forecast the energy demand of commercial buildings. We help these buildings use energy storage devices to reduce their electricity costs. I also recently completed my Masters in Industrial Engineering & Machine Learning from the University of Toronto, and am passionate about supporting women in engineering! "
1:45 PM,Vlad Filippov,7 years with three.js,"three.js is an open source project that makes it easy to create 3D scenes on the web, primarily with WebGL. The talk will give you a quick overview of the history of the project and where it is heading in the future.","I'm Vlad and I'm a software engineer on the Firefox team at Mozilla. I also contributed to many small and large open source projects throughout the years. My work has roamed widely: from desktop web development (client and server), to mobile, Android and 3D games. I love software testing, automation and reverse engineering. In the brief moments when I’m not coding, I enjoy playing tennis and reading comments on the Internet."
2:15 PM,Max Veytsman,Using Python to build the world's worst wifi router,"Scapy is a wonderful Python library that lets you construct raw network frames for almost any protocol you can think of.

In this talk, we'll use Scapy to write 802.11 frames, creating a fake wifi access point, and I'll show you one weird trick to de-anonymize cellphones Apple doesn't want you to know about.","After graduating from UofT, I spent five years as a professional hacker. Nowadays, I'm helping the world patch its software at Appcanary[https://appcanary.com/]."
Session 3,,,,
3:00 PM,sen,Designing for the Dark,"A local Toronto makerspace has a photographic darkroom where members can process many kinds of film, both black and white and colour. These chemical processes require a series of precisely-timed steps, during which film or paper are exposed to various chemical baths. Many of these processes require complete darkness – no red safelight – so it isn’t possible to use a timer with a visual user interface. Commercial timers solve this problem by beeping once per second. As one might imagine, this can become very annoying after an hour or more of working in the dark! The main hardware components of this project were a Raspberry Pi, a 2D barcode reader, and a custom button panel, and they are driven by a custom modular Ruby-based application. The timer designed in this project was intended to be less annoying and more functional than what was available commercially, and to be able to be used without the need for a visual UI.","I design and build blinkie art projects that survive extreme conditions, physical status displays which make the invisible visible, and other electronics to create simplicity, fun, and prettyness. I also take and process photos using traditional film processes and skate around in circles, sometimes for hours at a time."
3:15 PM,Alex Leitch,Colloquialisms in Javascript,"What's an if statement, and what does it tell us about the people who have written a given set of software? This talk covers four ways to write a conditional operator, and reasons for using different versions of each.

A basic introduction to code analysis, for people who are curious about slang in computer languages.","Alex Leitch is an award-winning kinetic artist and software developer in Toronto. Recent notable projects include Hothouse, an installation of interactive robot flowers at the Gladstone Hotel’s Come Up To My Room 2017. Alex has won a bunch of awards for a bunch of projects, but the best one was a massively carcinogenic flamethrower that never quite worked right. It’s terrifying and lives under a table. 
The second-best is the jar of human teeth given voluntarily by mainly strangers on Craigslist.
Alex currently works as a senior javascript developer and technical PM with Playground Inc."
3:30 PM,Aayush Rajasekaran,CS in Canada: An outsider looking in,"Come hear about my experiences as a queer, international person of colour studying in Canada. There's guaranteed to be one aspect of it that's way different than yours, and one aspect that's just like yours!

We might think the programming life is the same for all of us. But we're each coming from very different places. I'd like to tell you some stories that'll make you remember that more often.","Aayush is an international student from Dubai, currently doing research as a Master's student at the University of Waterloo. She has been programming for 8 years now, including at some neat co-op placements. She like people, trivia, Taylor Swift, and was once working on memorising all the Harry Potter books."
3:45 PM,Unconference,,,
Day 2,,,,
Session 4,,,,
11:00 AM,Rahim Mitha,Reverse Engineering: Writing a Triggerbot for any FPS Game,This talk will go over reverse engineering techniques and dive into the architecture of First Person Shooter games. We'll use our new understanding of game architecture to learn how to build an advanced triggerbot which defeats the short comings of conventional triggerbots.,"I am an iOS developer by day, and a gamer by night. I love to edit frag videos in my spare time. I hope to create world's first target agnostic aimbot someday. Also I like candy."
11:15 AM,Abigail Cabunoc Mayes,Ethics in Code,"Inspired by the discussion around fake news on Facebook, I want to explore what it means to be an ethical programmer. The tools and interfaces we create have a huge effect on our society. From designing logic with an ethical compass to current conversations around bias in machine learning, 

I'd like to introduce the audience to the kinds of questions they *should* be asking when they write code.","Abigail Cabunoc Mayes (@abbycabs), is the Lead Developer of Open Source Engagement at the Mozilla Foundation where she cares about code, science, prototyping and open source. Before this, she was Lead Developer of the Mozilla Science Lab transforming science on the web."
11:30 AM,Anne Cahalan,In vain have I struggled: Protocols & Prejudice,"When I first encountered Swift and its protocol-oriented approach, I felt like protocols were annoying, overcomplicated, and kind of smug. But as I learned more and encountered more complicated situations, I realized that a well-formed protocol can save you from all manner of social and coding disaster. ","I am an iOS developer and I have spent the last year constantly delighted by Swift. I'm passionate about clean code, craft cocktails, and nice yarn. Someday, I'll make an elegantly-designed app that pairs mixed drinks with knitting patterns, just you wait."
11:45 AM,Ankit Rastogi,Prescribing Code: My story of open source in healthcare.,"Being a healthcare worker with a computer science background helped me realize that there is a vast potential for software to improve healthcare systems at home and abroad. Although working within the constraints of healthcare systems has taught me about the barriers to implementing new software solutions, I am inspired and invigorated by the gradual adoption towards a more open and collaborative software development philosophy to improve and save the lives of others. In this talk I would like to illustrate my motivations for being involved in the software development community alongside my day job, outline the two open-source projects with which I am involved as well as demonstrate the impact and challenges that these projects have had on both an individual and population health level.","I am a final year resident physician in family medicine at the University of Toronto with programming background and a longstanding interest in open-source software. I am passionate about open hardware and software solutions that have a direct impact in significantly advancing individual and public health, in both developing and industrialized countries around the world. "
Session 5,,,,
1:00 PM,Josh Matthews,"Time travel, gdb, elephants, and you!","There you are, hunting down an intermittent bug in some complex multithreaded code. You're stepping through your code in the debugger, watching breakpoints fly by, and SUDDENLY it's too late! The problem you're looking for has already occurred, and you need to start all over again. Or do you?

The rr tool is the harbinger of an exciting new era of hassle-free debugging. Time travel has never been simpler, and an eidetic memory is within your grasp today! You will not believe how these wacky longstanding bugs in Firefox were solved!",I am a developer for Mozilla who absolutely loves making open source projects more accessible to new contributors. I also sing in a barbershop quartet called the Bearded Baritones.
1:15 PM,Leanne Shapton,Git Under The Hood,This talk will explain the basics of Git. It will show the objects and files generated by some of Git’s basic commands and how its graph structure manages project versioning. Spoiler: It is all just text.,My name is Leanne Shapton and I am currently a software developer at Shopify in Toronto. I specialize in building back-end platforms using Ruby on Rails. I co-organize RailsGirlsTO and teach at Ladies Learning Code. I love to learn and build fun stuff. 
1:30 PM,Ehsan Akhgari,Compiling to JS,"Over the recent years, the idea of compiling native languages such as C or C++ to JavaScript in order to run native programs inside a Web browser has become more and more popular.  Currently large codebases such as game engines have been ported to run inside a Web browser.   This talk covers the core idea of JS as a compilation target, a bit of the history and what lies ahead.","I have worked on various parts of the Firefox web browser for the past 10 years.  I love working on new technical challenges, typically in unfamiliar areas."
1:45 PM,William Lachance,Analyzing Web Browser Performance via Video Capture,"Automatically measuring the relative performance of different web browsers realistically has historically been challenging. Most existing solutions that do exist only measure things that are loosely correlated with user experience (e.g. JavaScript benchmarks). This presentation will discuss a testing framework I developed at Mozilla called ""Eideticker"" that uses automated analysis of a video capture of browser output to determine key metrics of their mobile browser against the competition (whether that be an earlier version of the product or an outright different one like Google Chrome or Opera)

In writing Eideticker, I wound up using a number of heuristics to make these measurements fast, quick, and parallelizable. This presentation will focus on discussing how I implemented these measurements, which will touch a number of issues in the field of computational vision.","I am a developer for Mozilla's Engineering Productivity team, specializing in performance automation and data analysis. I find artificial intelligence fascinating and try to apply techniques from the field to my own work, where it makes sense. I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada."
