    "description": "- Minimize the use of javascript for styling; CSS does that job better. Only use javascript to interact and render data.\r - Inline CSS and Script, improving first load speed, reducing the number of request.\r - Optimized images: use .webp for chrome, use .jpg otherwise\r ### Scalability & Automation (less work for me ::): :\r - markdown parse: documents written by other teammembers on Google Doc e.g. code of conduct, are converted to Markdown, and then rendered with [mark.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked), the only manual step is to download the updated markdown file onto the server.\r - csv parse: use [Papa Parse](http://papaparse.com/) library to parse csv of Speakers information (generated by google forms responses) into JSON, and then rendered. This makes updating speakers information effortless for the site maintainer (me).\r - csv parse(again): for calendar, updates in the google doc will get synced easily.\r ### Responsive & Interactive UI\r - Interactive canlendar: inspired by [Frosh](https://www.orientation.skule.ca/) to build a beautifully interactive calendar for the schedule page that provides an overall view without compromising details.\r - Modal: Code of Conduct page is built with a modal to ensure focused reading.",
