# Code of Conduct

Hello, Con! is dedicated to offering the programming community in the Greater Toronto Area an opportunity to teach, learn and **have fun**! To provide a good experience for everyone, we feel that it is necessary to provide a set of code of conduct for speakers, attendees and volunteers to follow. 

## The Short Version

Hello, Con! is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or anything else. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Hello, Con!.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## The Long Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, derisive comments regarding technical background, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for Hello, Con!.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates the anti-harassment policy, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

## Social Rules

In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy, we have a small set of [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) we follow. We (the organizers) believe that the rules from [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) contribute enormously to a supportive, productive, and fun learning environment. These rules are intended to be lightweight, and to make more explicit certain social norms that are normally implicit. Most of our social rules really boil down to "don’t be a jerk" or “don’t be annoying.” Of course, almost nobody sets out to be a jerk or annoying, so telling people not to be jerks isn’t a very productive strategy.

Unlike the anti-harassment policy, violation of the social rules will not result in expulsion from the conference or a strong warning from conference organizers. Rather, they are designed to provide some lightweight social structure for conference attendees to use when interacting with each other.

If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or social rules, please feel free to reach out to any of the conference organizers.
