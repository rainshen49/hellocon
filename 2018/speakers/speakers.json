When a group of computers talk to each other, a critical component of their communication is the way they keep time. Mechanisms like hardware clocks, logical timestamps, and NTP (network time protocol) have all been used to try to solve the same problem: how can distributed systems track time in synchrony? This talk will cover the timekeeping mechanisms used by popular databases today, but more broadly, explore what time fundamentally *means* to a computer system."},"Ridwan Howlader":{"name":"<h2 id=\"ridwanhowlader\">Ridwan Howlader</h2>","title":"<h3 id=\"impactfulmultidisciplinaryinnovation\">Impactful &amp; Multidisciplinary Innovation</h3>","link":"","linkicon":"","bio":"Ridwan Howlader is the Executive Director of the University of Toronto Aerospace Team.

Some of these are very conventional every day items, while others are technological marvels. All of these items have had a significant impact on society and its technical advancements. The development of software and design tools has advanced multidisciplinary innovation. The culture of digitization has enabled the growth of automation, and has resulted in an enriched quality of life. Students can capitalize on opportunities in these fields and potentially have a large impact."},"Stephen Piron":{"name":"<h2 id=\"stephenpiron\">Stephen Piron</h2>","title":"<h3 id=\"connectingthedotswithdeeplearning\">Connecting the Dots with DeepLearni.ng</h3>","link":"http://deeplearni.ng/","linkicon":"<i class=\"fas fa-link\"></i>","bio":"Stephen is co-founder of DeepLearni.ng, a company that builds real-world AI for enterprises.

These numbers were recorded in a book and “logging” was born! Over time, these ships evolved to include both quantitative data (ship’s speed, direction) and qualitative data (weather, mermaid sightings (yes actually!)).   As software developers and technologists, logs are a crucial part of our tool belt. I’ll go over the 500-year history of logging and explore how the nautical culture that gave us logs might offer us lessons for making us more effective at our craft."},"Gary Saarenvirta":{"name":"<h2 id=\"garysaarenvirta\">Gary Saarenvirta</h2>","title":"<h3 id=\"appliedartificialintelligence\">Applied Artificial Intelligence</h3>","link":"http://www.daisyintelligence.com","linkicon":"<i class=\"fas fa-link\"></i>","bio":"I am the founder and CEO of Daisy Intelligence.
