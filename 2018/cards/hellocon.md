<!-- followed by brief -->
Hello, Con! was first held in Feb 2017 at University of Toronto. It was a TED-talk style technology conference focusing on the fun of programming.
<!-- Followed by detail -->
Conventionally, tech conferences are comprised of hour-long talks based on either academic research or industry developments. While this traditional form serves as a good platform for exchanging ideas in fine details, Hello, Con! addresses a differentniche in a TED-talk style.

We aim to host a conference of digestible talks that share with attendees the joys and surprises of coding, instead of swarming technical details. We would like to host speakers with varied experiences and skill sets, allowing participants to gain different perspectives in not only software development, but also the delight and passion of programming adventures!
