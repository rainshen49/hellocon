Day 1,There is a 5min break between each talk,,
Session 1,Speaker,Title,Abstract
11:30 AM,Mike Conley,"Why I can play Maniac Mansion on my Windows 10 box, my Palm Pilot, and my DreamCast.","When I was growing up, I loved playing point-and-click adventure games. These are the 90's-era games where you play a character that walks around, talks to people, picks up things, and solves puzzles in order to progress the story. Famous examples include the Monkey Island series, Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max Hit the Road, The Dig, Gabriel Knight, the Kings Quest series and the Space Quest series. There are many more, but those were my favourites.

Those games are probably the primary reason I got into computing. I wanted to know how they worked, and I wanted to know how I could make one.

It turns out I'm not alone: an entire community exists to figure out how these sort of games work, and to get them to run on modern (and not so modern hardware). This is the ScummVM community.

This talk is mainly about what allows these games to be ported to such a diverse set of platforms without having any access to the original source code."
11:45 AM,Henrik Bechmann,Developing an interactive budget explorer for the Toronto budget using React and Google Charts,"We wanted to present the Toronto budget in an interactive analytics framework for relatively easy public consumption. We had some experience collecting city data, a lot of development experience, and some experience in organizing such data visually. To implement a solution we had to invent a data intake mechanism that accommodated low quality data, a taxonomy scheme to organize varying kinds of data, and a front end that could display both simple and (relatively) complex analytics. The front end also had to be responsive. A combination of reactive programming, hybrid state management, and clear component design lead to a successful early implementation"
12:00 PM,Ori Bernstein,Good Enough Malloc,"Production implementations of malloc are complex and difficult to understand. However, the core algorithm used in many of them is beautifully simple.

In this talk, I present a slab allocator that has comparable performance to the state of the art, in about 1% of the code. If there is time, I will discuss why it falls flat on its face under certain workloads, and what it would take to make it useful in production.
"
12:15 PM,Liz Baillie,Ruby is Awesome and Rust is Awesome and Building a Game in Both is AWESOME,"Learning to program in Ruby was super fun, but I kept hearing people talk about typed languages that are so-called ""closer to the metal,"" like Rust. It seemed intimidating, but I was curious! I built a small, text-based adventure game in both Ruby and Rust, side-by-side, so I could see what the differences and similarities were. I learned a lot, and now I'm here to share it all with you!"
Session 2,,,
1:30 PM,Charu Jaiswal,Using Deep Learning to Probe Scandals,Email scandals are all the rage now-- and so is deep learning. I'll be presenting how deep learning and natural language processing can be used to analyze one of the first major email datasets-- the Enron emails. The audience will also learn how they can get started in machine learning.
1:45 PM,Tanner Rogalsky,Art From Sine Waves,We will explore the use of sinusoidal and linear modulation across a time series to create looping graphics art. We will touch on both 2D and 3D uses for sinusoidal waves in the context of procedural graphics.
2:00 PM,Michael Kwan,"No battery, no (watch) life","Smartwatches need to be smaller and lighter than any handset, so they present some rather unique challenges when it comes to battery life.  There are oh so many ways you can inadvertently reduce a device's battery life. Here are a few stories on what happens when debugging and fixing low battery life on smartwatches."
2:15 PM,Max Veytsman,Using Python to build the world's worst wifi router,"Scapy is a wonderful Python library that lets you construct raw network frames for almost any protocol you can think of.

In this talk, we'll use Scapy to write 802.11 frames, creating a fake wifi access point, and I'll show you one weird trick to de-anonymize cellphones Apple doesn't want you to know about."
Session 3,,,
3:00 PM,sen,Designing for the Dark,"A local Toronto makerspace has a photographic darkroom where members can process many kinds of film, both black and white and colour. These chemical processes require a series of precisely-timed steps, during which film or paper are exposed to various chemical baths. Many of these processes require complete darkness – no red safelight – so it isn’t possible to use a timer with a visual user interface. Commercial timers solve this problem by beeping once per second. As one might imagine, this can become very annoying after an hour or more of working in the dark! The main hardware components of this project were a Raspberry Pi, a 2D barcode reader, and a custom button panel, and they are driven by a custom modular Ruby-based application. The timer designed in this project was intended to be less annoying and more functional than what was available commercially, and to be able to be used without the need for a visual UI."
3:15 PM,Alex Leitch,Colloquialisms in Javascript,"What's an if statement, and what does it tell us about the people who have written a given set of software? This talk covers four ways to write a conditional operator, and reasons for using different versions of each.

A basic introduction to code analysis, for people who are curious about slang in computer languages."
3:30 PM,Aayush Rajasekaran,CS in Canada: An outsider looking in,"Come hear about my experiences as a queer, international person of colour studying in Canada. There's guaranteed to be one aspect of it that's way different than yours, and one aspect that's just like yours!

We might think the programming life is the same for all of us. But we're each coming from very different places. I'd like to tell you some stories that'll make you remember that more often."
3:45 PM,Vlad Filippov,7 years with three.js,"three.js is an open source project that makes it easy to create 3D scenes on the web, primarily with WebGL. The talk will give you a quick overview of the history of the project and where it is heading in the future."
Day 2,,,
Session 4,,,
11:00 AM,Rahim Mitha,Reverse Engineering: Writing a Triggerbot for any FPS Game,This talk will go over reverse engineering techniques and dive into the architecture of First Person Shooter games. We'll use our new understanding of game architecture to learn how to build an advanced triggerbot which defeats the short comings of conventional triggerbots.
11:15 AM,Abigail Cabunoc Mayes,Ethics in Code,"Inspired by recent news (https://twitter.com/harrisj/status/799381711519940608 - fake news on fb), I want to explore what it means to be an ethical programmer. The tools and interfaces we create have a huge effect on our society. From designing logic with an ethical compass to current conversations around bias in machine learning, 

I'd like to introduce the audience to the kinds of questions they *should* be asking when they write code."
11:30 AM,Anne Cahalan,In vain have I struggled: Protocols & Prejudice,"When I first encountered Swift and its protocol-oriented approach, I felt like protocols were annoying, overcomplicated, and kind of smug. But as I learned more and encountered more complicated situations, I realized that a well-formed protocol can save you from all manner of social and coding disaster. "
11:45 AM,Ankit Rastogi,Prescribing Code: My story of open source in healthcare.,"Being a healthcare worker with a computer science background helped me realize that there is a vast potential for software to improve healthcare systems at home and abroad. Although working within the constraints of healthcare systems has taught me about the barriers to implementing new software solutions, I am inspired and invigorated by the gradual adoption towards a more open and collaborative software development philosophy to improve and save the lives of others. In this talk I would like to illustrate my motivations for being involved in the software development community alongside my day job, outline the two open-source projects with which I am involved as well as demonstrate the impact and challenges that these projects have had on both an individual and population health level."
Session 5,,,
1:00 PM,Josh Matthews,"Time travel, gdb, elephants, and you!","There you are, hunting down an intermittent bug in some complex multithreaded code. You're stepping through your code in the debugger, watching breakpoints fly by, and SUDDENLY it's too late! The problem you're looking for has already occurred, and you need to start all over again. Or do you?

The rr tool is the harbinger of an exciting new era of hassle-free debugging. Time travel has never been simpler, and an eidetic memory is within your grasp today! You will not believe how these wacky longstanding bugs in Firefox were solved!"
1:15 PM,Leanne Shapton,Git Under The Hood,This talk will explain the basics of Git. It will show the objects and files generated by some of Git’s basic commands and how its graph structure manages project versioning. Spoiler: It is all just text.
1:30 PM,Ehsan Akhgari,Compiling to JS,"Over the recent years, the idea of compiling native languages such as C or C++ to JavaScript in order to run native programs inside a Web browser has become more and more popular.  Currently large codebases such as game engines have been ported to run inside a Web browser.   This talk covers the core idea of JS as a compilation target, a bit of the history and what lies ahead."
1:45 PM,William Lachance,Analyzing Web Browser Performance via Video Capture,"Automatically measuring the relative performance of different web browsers realistically has historically been challenging. Most existing solutions that do exist only measure things that are loosely correlated with user experience (e.g. JavaScript benchmarks). This presentation will discuss a testing framework I developed at Mozilla called ""Eideticker"" that uses automated analysis of a video capture of browser output to determine key metrics of their mobile browser against the competition (whether that be an earlier version of the product or an outright different one like Google Chrome or Opera)

In writing Eideticker, I wound up using a number of heuristics to make these measurements fast, quick, and parallelizable. This presentation will focus on discussing how I implemented these measurements, which will touch a number of issues in the field of computational vision."
