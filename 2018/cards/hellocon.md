Hello, Con! was first held in Feb 2017 at University of Toronto ([2017 Homepage Here](/2017/oldhome.html)). It was a TED-talk style technology conference focusing on the fun of programming.

Conventionally, tech conferences are comprised of hour-long talks based on either academic research or industry developments. While this traditional form serves as a good platform for exchanging ideas in fine details, Hello, Con! addresses a different niche in a TED-talk style.

We aim to host a conference of digestible talks that share with attendees the joys and surprises of coding, instead of swarming technical details. We would like to host speakers with varied experiences and skill sets, allowing participants to gain different perspectives in not only software development, but also the delight and passion of programming adventures.

Hello, Con! was initially inspired by [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/) in New York. The first Hello, Con! inspired [Arshia Mufti](/#arshiamufti), one of this year's speakers, to start [StarCON](https://starcon.io/) at University of Waterloo. We would like this tradition to continue, to enable more developers to learn from each other in different industries.
